#Chan_Test

## Premise

This console application is my interpretation of an exercise out of the book:
Learn C# in One Day and Learn it Well by Jamie Chan.

I used this project as an area to try out different ideas as well as different string
formatting techniques. 

This was the first project I made from beginning to end, and as such I have a bit of
a soft spot for it.


## What I Learned

- Variable Scope

- String Formatting

- Thread Sleeping

- Return Functions
